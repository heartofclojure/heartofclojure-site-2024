abstract: "As a community, as collaborators, as coders, what does it mean to be \"open\"?\r\n\r\nThis goes way beyond \"open source\". Open practice can mean opening yourself up to vulnerability. It can mean opening the door to outside influence. It can also bring great benefit and *surprise*.\r\n\r\nI know this because I used to work in a very closed-off way. But over the past ten years, I've gradually adopted a more open practice. I am still learning what it really means to be open, but I want to (openly) share everything I've learned so far about the unexpected rewards it can bring.\r\n\r\nNormalise sharing scrappy fiddles!"
