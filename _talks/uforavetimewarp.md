  biography: "Miranda Kastemaa is a Helsinki-based musician, programmer and sound designer exploring sonic universes through a variety of algorithmic, electronic and acoustic means. Since 2002, they have worked with DAWs, livecoding, retrocomputing, field recording, game development, sensors, microcontrollers, game boys, piano and more, to create musical-visual instruments, interactive installations, participatory performances, as well as plain old tunes. Their scattershot and fragmentary artistic process is reflected in the resulting sounds, which meander through numerous styles like trance, ambient, drum & bass, downtempo, and noise, as well as the various aliases under which they've released music, including Foldplop, Verkosto and pulu.\r\n\r\n- <https://pulusound.fi/>\r\n- <https://pulu.bandcamp.com/>\r\n- <https://tiktok.com/@pigeonisms>\r\n- <https://youtube.com/@pulusound>\r\n- <https://soundcloud.com/pulusound>"

abstract: "In this algorithmic music performance collapsing the distance between 2000 and 2024, pulu unleashes a janky multi-computer contraption^W^W^Wcustom code-jockeying system to conjure hacker dreamworlds and hypnotic trance-scapes!\r\n\r\nFunctional programming permeates the performance, with SuperCollider 2 for Mac OS 9, TidalCycles (Haskell) and Emacs Lisp all playing a part in making the whole thing work(?)"
