- name: Teodor Heggelund
  biography: Teodor likes to program computers, especially with along other people. In previous lives, he has taught Elm to kids, Matlab and mechanics to students, and Python to civil engineers. His experience is that Clojure's interactivity makes it uniquely well suited to explore problems together.

  biography: I am a Clojure developer at the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. I have 20 years of experience building software, and have done Clojure full-time for the past 10 years. I write about software development occasionally at https://cjohansen.no and regularly at https://parenteser.mattilsynet.io (in Norwegian). I am the maintainer of some open source projects, notably Portfolio (https://github.com/cjohansen/portfolio), which was sponsored by Clojurists Together in 2023. I also demonstrate pair programming and using Clojure and ClojureScript to fight zombies in the screencast https://parensofthedead.com/

abstract: "What is Babashka? Why should you care?\r\n\r\nIn 90 minutes you’ll get an introduction to Babashka, and hands-on experience with it through a shared programming experience with the rest of the group and two veteran Clojure programmers. You’ll learn what Babashka is, how it fits in with JVM Clojure, and how to work with it in a practical sense.\r\n\r\nThe workshop aims to be a joyful learning experience where we’ll get to know each other better and learn more about REPL-driven programming, testing Clojure, and, of course scripting with Babashka."
