description: "The idea behind our project, called Klor (https://github.com/lovrosdu/klor), is to use a new domain-specific language (DSL) -- embedded in Clojure -- to write distributed systems as **choreographies**. A choreography is very similar to any \"normal\" Clojure program, except that it has a special message-passing primitive for processes to communicate: instead of the usual two `send` and `receive` primitives, there is just one `communicate` primitive that embodies a whole end-to-end transmission. The great thing about this is that bugs like communication mismatches and deadlocks -- very hard to diagnose and fix! -- become syntactically impossible to write in the first place. The choreography essentially acts as a single source of truth and is used to automatically generate the implementations of the processes in the system. `communicate` still compiles to a `send` and a corresponding `receive` behind the scenes, but it all happens completely transparently to the programmer.\r\n\r\nKlor is implemented on top of the `clojure.tools.analyzer` compiler framework and hooks into Clojure's macro system to perform all of its analysis and code generation at macroexpansion-time, imposing virtually no run-time cost on the user. It uses a lightweight \"type\" system to track the locations of values and knowledge shared between the processes, and supports standard higher-order features that help with composition and modularity. Still, Klor does not impose any hard restrictions and embraces the interactive and dynamically typed spirit of Clojure: there is seamless interoperability with external Clojure code and standard REPL-based development is highly encouraged. All in all, Clojure's excellent support for concurrency, host interop and mature tooling makes it a great foundation to use for Klor.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this talk is to demonstrate Klor's usage and highlight some of the interesting implementation challenges we faced."

abstract: Over the past five years, the European Commission has invested over 250M EUR in its **Next Generation Internet** initiative. As part of this ambitious program, we are developing a new free and open-source core technology for distributed systems -- in Clojure, of course.
