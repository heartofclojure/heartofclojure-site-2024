abstract: Come with all your questions about Cursive! I have developed Cursive from the very start, and I'd love to hear your questions, see how you're using Cursive and (hopefully!) help you with any problems you're experiencing. Whether you're an experienced Cursive user, an experienced Emacs user curious about why anyone might want to use anything else, or anywhere in between those two points, I'd love to hear from you and help with any issues you're experiencing.
