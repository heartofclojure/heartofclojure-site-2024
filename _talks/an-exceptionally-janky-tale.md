These days, he’s writing Clojure at Electronic Arts (EA) to build tooling used for making some of the world’s top games.\r\n\r\nJeaye is the creator of the jank programming language, a Clojure dialect on LLVM with a native runtime and C++ interop."

abstract: "Gather 'round, friends, it's story time! Hear the adventurous tale of plunging into unknown depths and meeting new friends along the way.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the interludes, we'll be plunging ourselves deep into the jank compiler and implementing our story's chapters: throw, try, catch, and finally. We won't shy away from the C++ involved, so be ready for a highly technical discussion.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you'll not only have your heart warmed, you'll also have a clear idea of how a non-trivial compiler feature is implemented, from parsing through to code generation."
