description: "- Is Clojure growth declining? Is it even growing? Where are we heading?\r\n- Analyze reasons why Clojure hasn't experienced explosive growth\r\n- Discuss challenges like perceived complexity, lack of familiar tooling, and smaller community compared to giants like Python.\r\n- Present data and surveys to support the points.\r\n\r\nPropose actionable ideas to attract new users:\r\n- Beginner-friendly tutorials and resources.\r\n- More focus on Clojure for specific domains (web dev, data science).\r\n- Increased outreach through workshops and meetups -- ClojureBridge etc.\r\n\r\n- Discuss the perception of Clojure as a difficult language.\r\n- Showcase success stories of beginners who transitioned to Clojure.\r\n\r\nMissing pieces:\r\n- Discuss potential missing elements in the Clojure ecosystem\r\n  - Do we need something like Rails / Django?\r\n- Limited industry adoption leading to fewer job opportunities.\r\n\r\nFEAR: Identify common reasons why developers might hesitate to learn Clojure:\r\n- Fear of a steep learning curve.\r\n- Concerns about job market saturation.\r\n- Uncertainty about the language's long-term viability.\r\n\r\nI plan to address all of these concerns with data, community experiences, and future-oriented arguments. I'll start conducting interviews  and collect as much information as I can from community and outsiders.\r\n\r\nI am open to changing the content of the talks if the premise seems exciting!"

abstract: "To the mainstream public (devs and business folks), clojure is either seen as an arcane lisp, or as a hyped language. This perception of Clojure is further solidified by the fact that it's hard to get started with Clojure.\r\n\r\nClojure definitely has a very passionate community and undeniable strengths, then what is holding it back? \r\n\r\nBy openly discussing these issues and collborating on solutions, we can propel Clojure beyond it's current position as a powerful defacto business choice. There are many low hanging fruits and quick wins we can do to get the ball rolling."
